    followed guidelines to create a secure RESTful API.
  <li> We connected our API to our frontend and implemented an api service, to allow simple access to our api for our frontend
    specific developers.
  <li> The frontend / full stack team built our SPA using React.js, using pure functional components by leveraging React 16 hooks.
  <li> CSS Grid was applied to the entire site to make it fully responsive.
